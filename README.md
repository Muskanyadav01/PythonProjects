This Python chatbot project uses machine learning to create a responsive conversational agent. It has three main components:

1. intents.json: Defines user intents like greetings, goodbye, and queries about age, name, and programming.
2. training.py: Preprocesses the intents data, tokenizes text, and trains a TensorFlow/Keras neural network model for intent classification.
3. chatbot.py: Loads the trained model and interacts with users in real-time, using NLTK for text preprocessing. The bot responds based on predicted intents with answers from intents.json.
